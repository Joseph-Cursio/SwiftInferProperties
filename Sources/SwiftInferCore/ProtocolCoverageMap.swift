/// pre-SemanticIndex stand-in for type resolution. Protocol coverage
/// is authoritative when the textual conformance match holds: the
/// kit's `check<Protocol>PropertyLaws` *does* verify the property the
/// template would have emitted. v1.5 plan open-decision #3 default
/// (a) full veto.
///
/// **Hand-baked transitive coverage.** Each entry's `Set<KnownProperty>`
/// already includes its parents'. `Numeric`'s set contains everything
/// `AdditiveArithmetic`'s contains, plus the multiplicative properties.
/// `SignedNumeric` contains `Numeric`'s plus `additiveInverse`. Computing
/// transitivity at lookup time would require modelling Swift's protocol
/// inheritance graph — a v1.1 constraint-engine concern (PRD §20.2) —
/// so v1.5 takes the ~14 × 5 = ~70 lookup-table-entry cost in exchange
/// for zero textual-conformance-walk logic.
///
/// **Textual-only matching, v1 limitation.** Like
/// `EquatableResolver.knownEquatableConformance`, this is a string
/// keyset. `: Swift.Numeric` written out fully won't match the bare
/// `"Numeric"` key (cycle-3 may add a normalization step that strips
/// known module prefixes; documented in v1.5 plan §"Out of scope").
/// Conditional conformance (`Array<T>: Equatable where T: Equatable`)
/// is not modelled either — a v1.1 constraint-engine concern.
/// User-defined protocols inheriting from a curated key
/// (`MyAlgebra: Numeric`) won't get coverage unless the conforming
/// type *also* textually lists `Numeric`.
///
/// **Empty sets are intentional placeholders.** `Semigroup` carries
/// `[]` because v1.5's algebraic templates don't emit a property the
/// kit's `checkSemigroupPropertyLaws` covers — there is no
