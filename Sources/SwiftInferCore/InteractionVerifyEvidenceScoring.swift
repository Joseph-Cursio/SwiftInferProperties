/// Cycle 112 — verify-as-signal post-pass for interaction-invariant
/// suggestions: the `InteractionInvariantSuggestion` analogue of the
/// algebraic `VerifyEvidenceScoring`. Folds persisted `verify-interaction`
/// outcomes — written by `VerifyInteractionPipeline.recordEvidence`
/// (cycle 111) — into the suggestion grade, so measured execution can
/// promote, or veto, a pick rather than only annotate it. This is the
/// consumer half of the cycle-110/111/112 "M9" join.
///
/// - `.measuredBothPass` → add `VerifyEvidenceScoring.verifyBothPassWeight`
///   (+50, shared with the algebraic fold so the two stay calibrated
///   together) to the score, recompute the tier **through the family's
///   Finding-G gate** (`InteractionInvariantFamily.tier(forScore:)`), then
///   apply `Tier.promoted(byVerifyOutcome:)`. For idempotence this lifts a
///   `.likely` pick (score 40) to `.verified` (40 + 50 = 90 → `.strong` →
///   `.verified`). For a `swiftProjectLintDeferral` family (cardinality,
///   biconditional) the gate pins `.possible` — **except** when a measured
///   bothPass is established at **full action-space coverage**
///   (`excludedActionCount == 0`): the cycle-135 pin-overrule then promotes
///   via the ungated tier (30 + 50 = 80 → `.strong` → `.verified`) and
///   discloses the overrule. A *partial* bothPass (or legacy `nil`
///   coverage) keeps the `.possible` pin — the family's failure mode lives
///   in the excluded composition actions, so partial coverage is biased
///   toward false-pass (cycle 135).
/// - `.measuredDefaultFails` → collapse to `.suppressed`; discover drops
///   it. An executed counterexample is not a heuristic guess — the same
///   precision argument that backs the algebraic veto (cycle 63).
/// - `.measuredEdgeCaseAdvisory` / `.measuredError` /
///   `.architecturalCoveragePending` are not verdicts → score-neutral
///   pass-through.
///
/// Pure and order-preserving. The `discover-interaction` render path runs
/// it once `verify-evidence.json` is loaded, **before** the visibility cut,
/// so a `bothPass` lift can clear the cut and a `defaultFails` veto drops
/// below it. A suggestion with no evidence passes through unchanged
/// (identical value, so callers can rely on `==`).
