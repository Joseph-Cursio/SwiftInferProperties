/// V2.0 M3.D — `swift-infer verify-interaction` subcommand surface.
///
/// **What it does.** Discovers reducer-shaped functions under
/// `Sources/<target>/`, applies the optional `--reducer` pin, emits
/// a verifier `main.swift` source via M3.B's `ActionSequenceStubEmitter`,
/// and renders the result. At M3.C/M3.D ship (this cycle), the
/// rendered output is "stub emitted, harness pending kit publication"
/// — the build-and-run loop lands at M3.E once the SwiftPropertyLaws
/// v2.2.0 tag is published. See `docs/calibration-cycle-73-findings.md`
/// "kit-tag-publication gap" for the next-action.
///
/// **CLI shape mirrors v1's verify-as-separate-subcommand posture.**
/// PRD v2.0 §3.6 step 5 sketches this as a `--interaction` flag on
/// the existing `verify`; v1.42's `verify` is rooted around a
/// suggestion-hash-prefix lookup against the SemanticIndex, so a
/// `--interaction` mode would force a structurally different output
/// path. Separate `verify-interaction` subcommand keeps the
/// boundaries clean — same posture as `discover-reducers`
/// (M1.A.3) vs `discover`.
