/// The first verify-ready CURATED ALGEBRAIC corpus. Packages
/// `Tests/Fixtures/algebraic-survey-corpus/` (the `Confidence` bounded-lattice
/// enum with static binary ops) and runs the measured `verify --all-from-index
/// --corpus-module` survey: the verifier path-depends on the packaged corpus +
/// `import`s its module, so the corpus's OWN types resolve as carriers (vs
/// cycle27-surface's library carriers). Demonstrates the algebraic
/// measured-verify path on a fresh public API surface — and the FIRST
/// verifying commutativity + associativity in the project (cycle27's were all
/// filtered false positives).
///
/// Spawns real `swift build`s resolving the algebraic deps; tagged
/// `.subprocess`. Fourteen picks across six families → 9 bothPass + 5 defaultFails:
///   - commutativity/associativity: `join` / `meet` (semilattice ops) →
///     comm + assoc bothPass (4); `leftBiased` (a first-non-medium fold) →
///     assoc bothPass but comm defaultFails — execution distinguishes the two
///     properties on one function;
///   - idempotence: `atLeastMedium` (clamp-up) → bothPass; `bumpUp` (saturating
///     step) → defaultFails (the idempotence false positive);
///   - round-trip: `Move.encode`/`Move.decode` (a genuine bijection on the same
///     carrier) → bothPass, the FIRST verifying round-trip in the project; plus
///     one spurious endomorphism pairing (`atLeastMedium`/`bumpUp` — the
///     template over-generates same-signature unary functions) → defaultFails;
///   - monotonicity: `Confidence.score` (a strictly-increasing Int projection)
///     → bothPass; `Confidence.priority` (a curated-named but non-monotone
///     projection — `.medium` outranks `.high`) → defaultFails;
///   - dual-style-consistency: `Toggle.reverse`/`reversed` (mutating + non-mutating
///     twins that agree) → bothPass, the first dual-style verified on a CUSTOM
///     (non-OrderedCollections) carrier; `Latch.reverse`/`reversed` (the
///     non-mutating twin is buggy — returns self unchanged) → defaultFails.
