# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository state

**M1 shipped; M2 in progress.** TemplateEngine M1 (round-trip + idempotence templates, cross-function pairing, suggestion-identity hashing, `// swiftinfer: skip` markers, §13 perf integration suite, §16/§14 hard-guarantee integration suite) is complete on `main`. Sub-milestones M1.1–M1.7 landed as individual `feat(M1.x):` commits. M1's §5.8 acceptance bar (golden-file explainability blocks, §13 perf budget on `swift-collections` + a synthetic 50-file corpus, §16 hard guarantees in CI) is met. The next milestone is M2 per `docs/M2 Plan.md` — commutativity / associativity / identity-element templates plus `.swiftinfer/config.toml` and `.swiftinfer/vocabulary.json` plumbing.

## What this repo is

**SwiftInferProperties** — type-directed property inference for Swift. Surfaces idempotence, round-trip pairs, and algebraic-structure (semigroup / monoid / group / semilattice / ring) candidates from function signatures, cross-function pairs, and existing unit tests. All output is human-reviewed; nothing auto-executes.

The package is a one-way downstream of [SwiftProtocolLaws](https://github.com/Joseph-Cursio/SwiftProtocolLaws):

```
SwiftInferProperties → SwiftProtocolLaws (PropertyBackend, DerivationStrategist) → swift-property-based
```

During pre-1.0 development, `Package.swift` references SwiftProtocolLaws via a local path (`../SwiftProtocolLaws`) so SwiftInfer can iterate against unreleased ProtocolLawKit changes. Swap to a versioned URL dep before tagging 1.0.

## Where to look

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| Product scope, milestones (M1–M9), success criteria | `docs/SwiftInferProperties PRD v0.3.md` |
| **Current milestone execution plan (M2 sub-milestones, target layout, deps)** | `docs/M2 Plan.md` |
| Closed milestone plans (M1) | `docs/archive/M1 Plan.md` |
| What v0.3 changed vs v0.1/v0.2 | The `Supersedes:` line points at git history of the SwiftProtocolLaws repo, where v0.1 and v0.2 lived before the split |
| ProtocolLawKit / ProtoLawMacro source of truth | the SwiftProtocolLaws repo, not this one |

## Design decisions baked into v0.3

A future Claude implementing the package should follow these decisions rather than re-litigate them. They live in the PRD; this is a quick map.

- **Conservative inference engine — high precision, low recall.** PRD §3.5. False positives are more damaging than missed opportunities; when in doubt, default to whichever option produces fewer suggestions.
- **All output is opt-in and human-reviewed.** Never auto-applies, never auto-executes, never auto-commits. Even in CI mode (PRD §9), it emits warnings, not failures.
- **The Daikon trap is the failure mode to avoid.** If benchmark calibration shows we're producing too many suggestions, the answer is to raise thresholds, not to add filters on top.
- **Three v1 contributions, one v1.1.** TemplateEngine + RefactorBridge + TestLifter ship in v1. SemanticIndex is deferred to v1.1 with the Constraint Engine, Domain Template Packs, IDE integration, and Semantic Linting bridge listed as the v1.1+ trajectory in PRD §20.
- **Explainability is a first-class output.** Every suggestion ships both "why suggested" and "why this might be wrong." PRD §4.5.
- **Generator inference delegates to SwiftProtocolLaws.** Don't reimplement the priority list — call into the shared `DerivationStrategist`. PRD §11.

## Build & test

- `swift package clean && swift test` (per the global `~/CLAUDE.md`) on session start.
- The skeleton expects `../SwiftProtocolLaws` to exist as a sibling checkout of [Joseph-Cursio/SwiftProtocolLaws](https://github.com/Joseph-Cursio/SwiftProtocolLaws). CI checks both repos out side-by-side; locally, your `~/xcode_projects/` should already have both.
- SwiftLint config lives at `.swiftlint.yml`; `swiftlint lint --quiet` should be silent.
